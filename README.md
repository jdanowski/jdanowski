Hi, I’m interested in semantic network and sentiment analysis of text (not images).
I’m currently working on optimal entropy meaasures to select the most informative content for semantic network analysis. Entropix is the R code that analyzes unstructured text data using entropy statistics.
A working paper describes the basis for these measures and their value, benchmarking the statistics across a diverse sample of 123 topics for which posts were extracted from Facebook's CrowdTangle database. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aPMRycKKUXdS62NuRz1H9jVyI-b1rf4jfti7c8oMuf8/edit?usp=sharing.
I'm interested in collaborating on semantic network research.  
Contact me at jdanowski@gmail.com.  Thanks.
